 Online Course Application - Assessment Feature

🛠 Project Overview

This project extends an Online Course Application by adding an interactive assessment feature. Students can now take exams, submit answers, and receive automated evaluations. The feature integrates seamlessly with existing course structures, ensuring a smooth user experience.

🔍 How It Works

Exam Creation: Course administrators can create exams via the Django Admin Panel, defining questions, choices, and correct answers.

User Interaction: Students can access the exam within the course detail page, select multiple correct choices, and submit responses.

Submission Processing: The backend processes answers using Django models and ORM queries, calculating scores dynamically.

Results Display: After submission, students receive instant feedback via a newly designed exam result template.

🚀 Key Features

✔ Full-Stack Implementation: Developed using Django (Python), HTML, and Bootstrap✔ Database-Driven Design: Utilized SQLite and Django ORM for data management✔ Authentication & Authorization: Implemented user authentication for secure exam access✔ Version Control & Deployment: Managed with Git & GitHub, including SSH authentication

This project highlights my ability to work with Django’s full-stack architecture, implement data models, manage database migrations, and enhance frontend interactivity using Bootstrap.
